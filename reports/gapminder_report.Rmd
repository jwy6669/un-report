## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
# include text, codes, figures in one report all in on.

```{r load-packages}
library(tidyverse)
```



```{r gdp-lifeExp-1997-plot2}
geom_histogram()
```

```{r gdp-lifeExp-1997-plot3}
# make plot of GDP (x-axis) vs LifeExp (y-axis)
gapminder_data_2007%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=gdpPercap,y=lifeExp))+
```


```{r gdp-lifeExp-1997-plot4}
gapminder_data_2007%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=gdpPercap,y=lifeExp))+
  geom_point()+
  labs(x="GDP Per Capita",y="Life Expectancy")

```
